This is a [ShowOff] presentation given by James Pearson for CPE 402 regarding
long-term health and maintenance of an open-source project.

`01-maintenance/slides.md` is a [Markdown] file containing the slide
definitions.  `notes.md` has my notes for the slides, since I'm a fan of sparse
slides.  Markdown files are designed to be able to be read just as normal text
files, if you'd like; there are also a number of tools available online for
converting to HTML, PDF, and other common formats.

If you'd like to convert the slideshow to a series of static HTML/CSS/JS files,
run `showoff static` in this directory.  You can also visit
http://changedmy.name/foss-maintenance/ to view them.
